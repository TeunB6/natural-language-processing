\section{Dataset \& Setup}
This project focuses on the AGNews Dataset, created by Zhang et al. \cite{AGNews}. The dataset consists of 120k training datapoints and 7.6k testing points. Each datapoint consists of a title and a description of a news article. These are around 45 and 200 characters long on average. Each article is categorised based on topic. The set of labels consists of World, Sports, Business and Sci/Tech ($C=4$, $y\in\{1,2,3,4\}$). This project aims to investigate the performance of baseline models on this task. For hyperparameter tuning and testing, a random development split of 10\% was taken from the training set.

To train models, first, the data needs to be preprocessed. The first step was to concatenate the title and the description into a single string of text, which makes it easier to use both features. 

Next, an embedding needs to be made, his was done using a Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Vectorizer as implemented in Scikit-Learn \cite{scikit-learn}. The term frequency of a word is the number of times it occurs in a given document (sample). The inverse document frequency is a measure of how much information a term provides; this is based on the number of documents in which the term appears. The idea is that terms that appear in fewer documents provide more information than those that appear in many documents. Using these two steps, a co-occurrence matrix is computed for each document, and the different entries are weighted based on the TF-IDF values. For this project, it was chosen to work with 5000 features. Thus for each sample $i$ we get a sparse matrix $x_i\in \boldsymbol{M}_{5000\times5000}$. Additionally, we chose 33 as our fixed random seed.

\section{Models}
\subsection{Logistic Regression}
Logistic Regression consists of a linear classification model, as specified in Equation \eqref{eq:linmodel}

\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{a} = \boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x}
    \label{eq:linmodel}
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol{a}$ is a vector of logits, $\boldsymbol{x}$ is the feature vector and $\boldsymbol{W}$ is a matrix of weights \cite{pml1Book}. To convert these logits to a probability, the softmax activation function is used, specified in Equation \eqref{eq:softmax} \cite{pml1Book}.

\begin{equation}
    p(y=c|\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{W}) = \frac{e^{a_c}}{\sum_{c'=1}^C e^{a_{c'}} }
    \label{eq:softmax}
\end{equation}
\\
The final prediction of the class is the value for which this probability is maximal. The model is trained through Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), in which it finds the parameter values that make the observed data most probable. To solve the optimisation problem, the Limited Memory BFGS algorithm is used, in which we approximate the curvature from the second derivative to calculate the minimum error. By default, the model from Scikit-Learn applies L2 Regularisation \cite{scikit-learn}. This modifies the objective function by adding a penalty term proportional to the square of the weight magnitudes controlled by the inverse regularisation strength hyperparameter $C$. 

\subsection{Support Vector Machine}
The goal of a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is to find a maximum separation hyperplane between data points of two sets \cite{lwkBook}. To generalise this to more than two classes, a one-vs-rest classification strategy was used. A hyperplane in an inner-product space is specified using the orthogonal vector $\boldsymbol{w}$ and an offset $b$. To measure this, we require all data points to be members of an inner-product space, which is $\boldsymbol{M}_{5000\times5000}$ in the present case. We calculate the error metric with Hinge Loss, seen in Equation \eqref{eq:hinge_loss} \cite{lwkBook}.

\begin{equation}
    L = \max(0, 1 - y_i(\boldsymbol{w} \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_i + b))
    \label{eq:hinge_loss}
\end{equation}

Since there is not always a hard margin between two sets, to find the optimal separating hyperplane, it is necessary to use a slack on the loss. The ratio between minimising the training error and maximising the margin is parameterised by C \cite{lwkBook}. This is achieved by minimising the objective function, specified in Equation \eqref{eq:objective_svm}

\begin{equation}
    \min_{w,b,\zeta } \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \zeta_i
    \label{eq:objective_svm}
\end{equation}

where $\zeta_i$ reflects the the Hinge loss for each datapoint and $C$ is the (tuned) hyperparameter \cite{lwkBook}. The penalty ensures that points falling inside the margin or on the incorrect side of the hyperplane are penalised linearly. Unfortunately, there is not a consistent way to select this hyperparameter a priori; thus, for this project, it was opted to tune this using a 5-fold grid search on $C \in \{10^{-3}, 10^{-2}, 10^{-1}, 10^{0}, 10^1, 10^2, 10^3\}$. Based on these results, $C=10^{-1}$ was the best option. The full results can be found in Appendix \ref{ap:gridsearch}.

\section{Experimental Protocol}
The main goal of this report is to compare the baseline models above. For these purposes, we train both models on the same training set. We evaluate the models on the development and testing sets based on multiple metrics. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, weighted F1-score (which accounts for label imbalance) and a confusion matrix. Additionally, an elaborate error analysis is done for the best model, focusing on the different types of errors and their (potential) causes. 

\section{Results}

\subsection{Logistic Regression}

The Logistic Regression model reported, for the development set, an accuracy of $0.8748$ and a weighted F1-score of $0.8742$; for the test set, the model reported an accuracy of $0.7470$ and a weighted F1-score of $0.7455$. The model achieved a higher performance on the development set but saw a noticeable decline when applied to the test set. The confusion matrix comparison is shown in Table \ref{tab:logreg_cm}.

\subsection{Support Vector Machine}

The SVM model, tuned with $C=0.1$, reported, for the development set, an accuracy of $0.8776$ and a weighted F1-score of $0.8769$; for the test set, the model reported an accuracy of $0.7661$ and a weighted F1-score of $0.7645$. This model slightly outperforms the Logistic Regression model on both the development and test sets, and demonstrates better robustness. The confusion matrix comparison is shown in Table \ref{tab:svm_cm}.

\section{Error Analysis}
\subsection{General}

Looking at the confusion matrix of the Logistic Regression shows us that sports is the least often misclassified of all categories. Business, on the other hand, is most often misclassified. The most common misclassifications are Business being classified as Sci/Tech and Sci/Tech being classified as Business. This could possibly be explained by the fact that a lot of Business articles contain words and sentences like: "The launch of ...", "The largest Internet Retail ...", "The release to manufacturing of Microsoft Operations Manager". In short, in the misclassified articles that fall in the Business class, words appear that can signify an article falling under the Sci/Tech class.
 
On the other hand, we can see a similar phenomenon happen with Sci/Tech articles. When inspecting Sci/Tech articles, it becomes evident that many are about Tech companies making progress on a project or seeing more / less sales. In other words, a lot of words relating to Business can be observed in Sci/Tech articles. The Business and Sci/Tech articles thus have some overlap, which causes misclassification among these categories. Looking back at the Sports category, it can be deduced that in Sports articles, a certain language is used that simply pertains mostly to only Sports articles, causing it to be less often confused or misclassified. Examples can include the name of a sport or sports team, sports terms like "Championship", "Grand prix" or sentences like "eight-run inning" and "A two-run deficit for a 4-2 win Sunday". The articles that do get misclassified are articles about, for example, lawsuits regarding Sports players, or news about the Olympics, which fall under the category World instead of Sports.
 \\
For the SVM, we can see the exact same phenomena: Sports is least often misclassified, Business and Sci/Tech are most often confused for each other, and Business is most often misclassified. The division in which classes are often misclassified is very similar across both models; it seems that they make the same type of errors. A total of 24 cases of misclassification can be inspected in the Appendices for both the SVM (Appendix B, Table \ref{tab:misclassificationSVM}) and the Logistic Regression (Appendix C, Table \ref{tab:misclassificationLM}). These tables categorise the errors based on their predicted and actual topic.
\\
\subsection{Specific Examples for Best Model}
As the results show, the SVM is the better-performing model. Ten cases of misclassification for this model will be inspected in detail. The written-out text for these ten cases can be found in Appendix \ref{ap:log_reg_miss} (Table \ref{tab:misclassSVM}). It can be stated that the articles are misclassified because of specific word usage. A common occurrence is that articles belonging to the Business class talk about Scientific terms. This phenomenon can be observed in references 1 and 2. Reference 1 mentions "Web giant Yahoo" and "Web hosting products", which are common Tech terms; this article is misclassified as Sci/Tech. Reference 2 names a lot of different tech equipment; this article thus also gets misclassified as Sci/Tech. For reference 3 and 4, the misclassification can be seen quite easily; they are articles belonging to the World class, which talk about Olympic gold and a lawsuit regarding a Greek Weightlifter. The amount of Sports terms in these articles causes them to be classified as Sports articles. In references 5 and 6, the same thing happens for Business articles, where reference 5 mentions "Strategy" and "Staying ahead", while reference 6 plainly talks about a "Major League Baseball team", all of these are sports-related terms, causing a Sports classification. The inverse of this can be seen in references 7 and 8, where Sports articles regard Transfers or bids, which are business-related concepts. For reference 9, there are some Science terms being thrown around, like "energy" in combination with "fuel tank". For reference 10, it is a bit more difficult to detect which exact words cause the misclassification as Sci/Tech, but it might be words like "beams", "boost", "success" and "Stature in Europe" that are more often used in Sci/Tech articles than in Sports articles.

\section{Discussion}
The goal of this assignment was to discuss two different models, the SVM and Logistic Regression, in their capacity as potential baseline models for the AG News topic classification task. Based on a combination of the F1-score and the accuracy, the SVM is considered the superior baseline model as it slightly outperforms Logistic Regression in all metrics. Based on the confusion matrix and the more expanded error analysis, we can conclude that both models make very similar errors and are both valid baseline models. The errors can be summarised as being caused by terminologies being shared between different topics. For example, there are a lot of scientific terms used in Business and Sports articles. 
\\
There are also a few points of improvement. Firstly, there is the issue of normalisation. In our original pipeline, it was assumed that the TF-IDF feature was sufficiently normalised. In later testing, it seems that additional improvements could be made by normalising these values by using the standard deviation and assuming a zero mean (needed for sparse matrices). Lastly, significant improvements in training time and performance could be made by switching to the liblinear-based LinearSVC class, which is better optimised for large datasets \cite{scikit-learn}. This also uses a one-vs-one approach to multiclass classification, which seems to provide some small improvements as well. Due to time constraints, it was not possible to fully investigate the consequences of these changes for the error analysis, and this is left for future work.
