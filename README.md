## Command Line Interface

This project uses a CLI built with [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html) for a clean interface and to provide a fresh-out-of-the-box project immediately after cloning. Using the CLI, you can interact with all the required deliverables per assignment efficiently.
